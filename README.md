# Federal Contract Compliance Co-Pilot ü§ñüìú

An AI-powered agentic system designed to analyze federal Request for Proposal (RFP) documents, extract key requirements, and identify compliance risks using Amazon Bedrock.

---

## üéØ The Problem

Government and enterprise contracts, particularly RFPs, are often hundreds of pages long. Manually reviewing these documents to ensure full compliance is a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. A single missed requirement can lead to a non-compliant proposal and a lost opportunity.

This project builds an "Analyst Co-Pilot" to automate this review process, saving time and reducing risk.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Q&A:** Ask questions about the RFP document in plain English.
* **Automated Requirements Extraction:** Automatically identifies and lists all mandatory requirements (clauses containing "shall," "must," etc.).
* **Risk Identification:** Flags potentially ambiguous or contradictory language that may require legal review.
* **Executive Summary:** Generates a concise summary of the document, highlighting key dates, deliverables, and sections.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built using a modern, scalable stack designed for building and deploying agentic AI applications.

* **Cloud & AI Services:**
    * **Amazon Bedrock:** Provides access to powerful foundation models (e.g., Anthropic's Claude 3).
    * **Amazon Titan Embeddings:** Used for generating vector representations of the document text.
* **Core Framework:**
    * **LangChain / LangGraph:** Used to build the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and orchestrate the multi-agent system.
* **Application & Deployment:**
    * **FastAPI:** Exposes the agent's functionality via a REST API.
    * **Poetry:** Manages Python dependencies and project packaging.
    * **Docker:** Containerizes the application for consistent and portable deployment.
